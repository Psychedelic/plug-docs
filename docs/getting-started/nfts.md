# NFTs in Plug

![](imgs/nfts.png)

As of V0.3.1, we've added the **NFTs Tab** in your main assets view! With Plug, you will be able view the NFTs held/owned by your Principal ID (currently only compatible ones), view a specific NFT's details and attributes, and send them through Plug's UI to a different Principal ID.

## ICPunks & Bulding New NFT Standards

Currently Plug only supports the [ICPunks collection](https://icpunks.com/), the only automatically surfaced and supported NFT. You can redeem it with your Plug wallet, tied to your Principal ID.

We will roll out support for auto-surfacing other NFTs as a community-standard is further developed and matured, as well as we continue to develop a registry/list open internet service for Tokens, NFTs, and Dapps, to help improve discoverability [(DAB - Learn More)](https://dab.ooo/)

### Why Start Here?

The ecosystem still needs to push and develop a conjoint NFT standard interface, and **we are supporting ICPunkâ€™s early NFT standard proposal as a step in the right direction**. Why do we support it?

- [Main Repository](https://github.com/stopak/ICPunks)
- [Standard Interface](https://github.com/stopak/ICPunks/blob/dev/service/icpunks_rust.did)

In contrast to other standards on the Internet Computer for NFTs the direction ICPunks has taken with their NFT standard takes an important leap: the trading and exchange features that would usually be covered by marketplaces **(listing for sale, view listed tokens, purchases) are built into the NFT contract/canister itself** ðŸ¤¯

That means no more marketplace-specific assets, or walled NFT gardens. All NFTs using this standard are interface/marketplace agnostic, and could be listed or traded anywhere. The NFT collection itself is its own marketplace and listing. For us, that is the next necessary leap for NFTs ðŸ˜Ž

Again, as we said, itâ€™s early. This standard has to be discussed, and has to evolve into a community-effort, but we see the current interface implementation as a solid base layer to build upon, and that we will support as a standard going forward.

## Viewing NFT Details & Sending an NFT
In the Plug interface, you will now see the new NFTs tab!

If your wallet's Principal ID owns a compatible NFT (like ICPunks) Plug will auto-surface your owned assets in a list.

If you **click on one of your NFTs** you will enter the **details view**, where you can see the NFT's specific attributes, the collection's details, and more information.

Here you can also use the Marketplace button to view the asset on a marketplace (if available), or **use the SEND button** to transfer your NFT to a different Principal ID.

Want to send an NFT you own to someone else? It is as easy as entering that person's Principal ID, and hitting send. Plug will handle the rest.
