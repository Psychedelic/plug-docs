## I’m unable to see the secret recovery phrase when creating a new wallet?

If you cannot see your secret recovery phrase when first installing Plug, please troubleshoot by following the steps below:

1. Manually remove the Plug extension.
2. Close and reopen your browser.
3. Reinstall the latest version of Plug extension on Chrome/Firefox.  

This should fix your issue and ensure you have the latest, non-corrupted version of Plug for your browser. 

If your issue persists please reach out to us in the #support channel of our Discord with a short explanation of the error, your browser version, and your OS version so we can begin the troubleshooting process and help you resolve the issue.

## Why has my Principal ID changed after installing the latest version of Plug?

This is due to our curve change, in effect as of Plug V0.2.1. Please follow our [curve migration guide](https://docs.plugwallet.ooo/resources/migrating-curve/) to learn about what happened and how to migrate our assets, thank you for your cooperation. 

If your issue persists or you have any questions regarding the curve change, please reach out to us in our Discord #plug channel which you can find [here](https://discord.gg/fleekhq).

## I click on “Connect with Plug” in an app, but it takes me to Plug's page? 

If you are trying to **connect to an app with Plug** just after installing it,  make sure you refresh the browser before proceeding. Try force refreshing by using “Ctrl + Shift + R” or "Command + Shift + R" on Mac closing and reopening the browser and then trying again to connect.

## I imported my account to a new browser/device but can't see all my accounts? 

If you had sub-accounts, and then used your **recovery phrase** to import your wallet onto a different browser, your sub-accounts won't be visible right away but are not lost. [See this guide](https://docs.plugwallet.ooo/resources/multiple-accounts/) to learn how to re-add them.
