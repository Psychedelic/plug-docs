## Why aren’t my tokens & NFTs loading in Plug?

---

### Option 1: Clock Error

The NNS ledger is very strict about requests to the ledger & when they expire. There’s a known error: if your clock on your Windows/MacOS/Mobile device is not set to time updating “automatically” and is out of sync, the NNS ledger will reject your query to check your assets.

To fix this:

1. Visit your device time/date settings.
2. Make sure set time zone is set to “automatically”.
3. That’s it! Restart your browser, and Plug should show all your assets.

### Option 2: Canister Down Error

If you are receiving the “Canister Down” error while for example visiting the NFT tab and not seeing your ICPunk or other NFT/assets it might be due to the NFT’s or projects canister being down. 

There’s nothing that can be done directly from Plug to troubleshoot this issue, please contact the team of the asset/canister/NFT that isn’t loading for more information and wait for them to bring it back online.

### Option 3: Subnet Down Error

If nothing is loading or showing, you may receive the “Subnet Down” error message, this means that the Internet Computer is currently having some trouble processing requests to the subnet due to a variety of factors such as high traffic, performance upgrades, user throttling, etc.

There’s nothing Plug can do to resolve this issue, please wait until the subnet is brought back online & stay up-to-date with Internet Computer.
