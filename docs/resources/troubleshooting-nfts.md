## Why are my NFTs not showing up?

There‚Äôs a few reasons why NFTs could be not showing up in your Plug account. 

1. The NFT project is not supported by DAB.
2. DAB is down, unable to fetch the canister registry list for NFTs.  
3. The project‚Äôs NFT Canister is down.
4. The Internet Computer Subnet is down. 

To begin troubleshooting, we‚Äôll need to figure out what the error message is by checking background controller logs. To do this, we‚Äôll access the Plug extension **Background Console.**

### NFT Project Not Supported Error: Not Supported by DAB

### NFT Collection Canister is Down or Out of Cycles
